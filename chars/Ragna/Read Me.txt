Ragna the Bloodedge
From Blazblue / Blazblue Cross Tag Battle
Version 1.1611
For M.U.G.E.N 1.0 and above
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Note
==========================================================================================
This character was made with only single and turns mode in mind, so using this in simul mode is probably not a good idea.

-New Mechanic: Not Over Yet
  -Upon reaching 35% health or below and not being in a hurt state, you will receive the following benefits for the rest of the round:
   +All Distortion Drives deal 20% more damage (Stacks with Ultra Burst's damage buff)
   +Immediately Gain 500 Meter
   +Slowly gain meter overtime

  -Only triggers once per round
-New Mechanic: Ultra Dead Angle (Burst while Guarding)

-Stationary, Forward, and air dodges now have less invul time against physical attacks
-Invul time upon air recovery lasts a little longer and control is regained a little sooner

- Fix bugs and errors that I might have missed
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Introduction
==========================================================================================
This Ragna uses a custom gameplay style. Though he's not source accurate, he still plays similarly to how he does in Cross Tag while having new stuff, as well as a few old moves from previous Blazblue titles. This read me will explain how this gameplay style works. His move list can be found in the .png included in this folder. 
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Default Button Layout
==========================================================================================
A, B, and C: Attack Buttons

X: Rapid Cancel

Y: Dodge

Z: Grab
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Gameplay Mechanics
==========================================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Double Jump (Tap Up in the air)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pretty self explanatory, allows you to jump a second time in the air. Can be canceled into after connecting any of your air normals. Can only be used once in the air, can't be used if you have already air dashed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Air Dash (Double Tap Forward/Back while in the air)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sends you flying forward or back for a set distance. Can be canceled into after connecting any of your air normals. Can only be used once in the air, can't be used if you have already double jumped.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dodge (Y)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a very short amount of time, you'll become invulnerable and can pass through the opponent and their projectiles. Just pressing Y will keep you stationary, pressing Y and forward at the same time will have you move forward a short distance, and pressing Y and back will have you back dash. The stationary dodge can also be done in the air. You will become vulnerable again near the end of the dodge animation, so be carful about how you time it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grab (Z)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once again, pretty self explanatory. Overrides the opponent's guard, but only works if they're not in the air and not in a hit state

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Air Grab (Z in the air)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inversely, only works on airborne opponents and can work even when they're in a hit state. Can be used as a combo ender.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running Grab (Z While Running)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Works on airborne opponents and standing opponents even when they're in a hit state. However, it won't work on crouching opponents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapid Cancel (X When your attack has made contact with the opponent) (Costs 1000 meter) (Costs 500 meter if used during a Distortion Drive)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using this will immediately put you in a neutral state, this can be used to extend combos, make otherwise unsafe moves safe, or make you more unpredictable to your opponent. Holding Forward or back while inputing the command will immediately have you run or back dash respectively (Air Dash Forward/Back when in the air), Holding up will immediately make you jump, and holding down while in the air will quickly bring you back to the ground.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dead Angle Attack (Press Forward and X or Forward and B+C While guarding) (Costs 1000 meter)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cancels your guard animation into an invulnerable attack animation that sends the opponent flying backward. Deals damage, but doesn't kill.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burst (y+z while getting hit) (Can only be used once per round) (Doesn't work if you're in a custom state)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deploys a non damaging blast around your character that sends you opponent flying away from you. A poorly timed burst can leave open for even more damage, so be careful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake up Action
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wake up animation can be canceled into a forward dodge or a back dash. In Ragna's case, he can aslo cancel into Inferno Divider.

==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Character Specific Mechanics
==========================================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soul Eater
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ragna's maximum health is below average. However, certain moves will steal some of the opponent's health upon contact.
The following attacks steal health:

5AAAA
5BB (second hit)
5C
2C
jB
Dead Spike
Follow up attacks for Hell's Fang, Gauntlet Hades, and Nightmare Edge
Inferno Divider and Axe Kick
EX Dead Spike and both of it's follow ups
