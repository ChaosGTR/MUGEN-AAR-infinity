Carmine
From Under Night In-Birth
Version 1.0211
For M.U.G.E.N 1.0 and above
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Notes
==========================================================================================
-This character was made with only single and turns mode in mind, so using this in simul mode is probably not a good idea.

-It is recommended that you set the WavChannels to 64 or higher in mugen.cfg. This will prevent sound effects from cutting each other off.

-Due to the custom fall states, Stupa's Training character will not realize that they can recover despite "recover" being turned on. To fix this, Paste this code at the bottom of Training's config file:

[State 5050, 4] ;Recover near ground
type = SelfState
triggerall = stateno = 6050
triggerall = Vel Y > 0
triggerall = Pos Y >= -20
triggerall = alive
triggerall = CanRecover
trigger1 = Command = "recovery"
trigger2 = var(16) = 1
trigger2 = var(23)>=var(22)
value = 5200 ;HITFALL_RECOVER

[State -2]; Recover in mid air
type = selfState
triggerall = stateno = 6050
triggerall = Vel Y > -1
triggerall = alive
triggerall = CanRecover
trigger1 = Command = "recovery"
trigger2 = var(16) = 1
trigger2 = var(23)>=var(22)
value = 5210 ;HITFALL_AIRRECOVER

-Downloading this character from Mugen Guild or OHMSBY's Mugen site ensures that this is the latest version.

-New Mechanic: Not Over Yet
  -Upon reaching 35% health or below and not being in a hurt state, you will receive the following benefits for the rest of the round:
   +All Distortion Drives deal 20% more damage (Stacks with Ultra Burst's damage buff)
   +Immediately Gain 500 Meter

-Invul time upon air recovery lasts a little longer and control is regained a little sooner

Introduction
==========================================================================================
This Carmine uses a custom gameplay style. Though he's not source accurate, he still plays similarly to how he does in Cross Tag while. This read me will explain how this gameplay style works. His move list can be found in the .png included in this folder. 
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Default Button Layout
==========================================================================================
A, B, and C: Attack Buttons

X: Rapid Cancel

Y: Dodge

Z: Grab
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Gameplay Mechanics
==========================================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Double Jump (Tap Up in the air)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pretty self explanatory, allows you to jump a second time in the air. Can be canceled into after connecting any of your air normals. Can only be used once in the air, can't be used if you have already air dashed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Air Dash (Double Tap Forward/Back while in the air)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sends you flying forward or back for a set distance. Can be canceled into after connecting any of your air normals. Can only be used once in the air, can't be used if you have already double jumped.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dodge (Y)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a very short amount of time, you'll become invulnerable and can pass through the opponent and thier projectiles. Just pressing Y will keep you stationary, pressing Y and forward at the same time will have you move forward a short distance, and pressing Y and back will have you back dash. The stationary dodge can also be done in the air. You will become vulnerable again near the end of the dodge animation, so be carful about how you time it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grab (Z)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once again, pretty self explanatory. Overrides the opponent's guard, but only works if they're not in the air and not in a hit state

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Air Grab (Z in the air)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inversely, only works on airborne opponents and can work even when they're in a hit state. Can be used as a combo ender.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running Grab (Z While Running)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Works on airborne opponents and standing opponents even when they're in a hit state. However, it won't work on crouching opponents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapid Cancel (X When your attack has made contact with the opponent) (Costs 1000 meter) (Costs 500 meter if used during a Distortion Drive)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using this will immediately put you in a neutral state, this can be used to extend combos, make otherwise unsafe moves safe, or make you more unpredictable to your opponent. Holding Forward or back while inputing the command will immediately have you run or back dash respectively (Air Dash Forward/Back when in the air), Holding up will immediately make you jump, and holding down while in the air will quickly bring you back to the ground.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dead Angle Attack (Press Forward and X or Forward and B+C While guarding) (Costs 1000 meter)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cancels your guard animation into an invulnerable attack animation that sends the opponent flying backward. Deals damage, but doesn't kill.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burst (y+z while getting hit) (Can only be used once per round) (Doesn't work if you're being thrown or being hit by a super)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deploys a non damaging blast around your character that sends you opponent flying away from you. A poorly timed burst can leave open for even more damage, so be carful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ultra Burst (y+z while in a neutral state) (Can only be used once per round)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using this will put you in a powered up state that gives the following benefits:
 +Health and Meter will gradually recover overtime (Unless you're taking damage)
 +Damage output will be increased by 20%
 +Timer will be frozen
 +Hitting the opponent with the Ultra Burst will launch them upward and will be unable to recover from it
 +Hitting the opponent with the ultra burst will also grant 500 meter instantly
The time that the Ultra Burst state will last is proportionate to the amount of health lost prior to activating, Attempting an astral heat will immediately end the Ultra Burst state


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake up Action
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wake up animation can be canceled into a forward dodge or a back dash. In Carmine's case, He can also cancel into PULVERIZE!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter hit properties
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All attacks will deal bonus damage if they hit the opponent while they're attacking and in some cases, causes more hit stun and more unrecoverable time.

==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Character Specific Mechanics
==========================================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reverse Beat
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carmine can chain his normal attacks in any given order, assuming that the attack hasn't already been used in the same chain.
For instance, Carmine can make a chain that goes like this:

2C > 5A > 5BB

However, he CANNOT make a chain that goes like this:

5B > 5A > 5B > 5A

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood Spike
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following attacks will leave a dissolve on the ground in exchange for health:

5B
jB
jC
SPIN!
EX SPIN!
LAUNCH!
THRUST!

The following attacks will manipulate dissolves to do the following:

5BB / jBB: Spike Arch
SPIN! / EX SPIN!: Blood Wheel
LAUNCH! / NO ESCAPE!: Spike Column
THRUST!: Delayed Spike Explosion

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood Absorb
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All of Carmine's throws and 5AAAA will heal Carmine. The amount of health gained scales according to how much health he is missing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HAHAHAHA! BE DEVOURED!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While this move can hit the opponent from any distance, Carmine will only go into the follow up if the opponent is close enough.
