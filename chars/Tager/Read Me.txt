Iron Tager
From Blazblue
Version 1.09
For M.U.G.E.N 1.0 and above
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Notes
==========================================================================================
-This character was made with only single and turns mode in mind, so using this in simul mode is probably not a good idea.

-It is recommended that you set the WavChannels to 64 or higher in mugen.cfg. This will prevent sound effects from cutting each other off.

-Due to the custom fall states, Stupa's Training character will not realize that they can recover despite "recover" being turned on. To fix this, Paste this code at the bottom of Training's config file:

[State 5050, 4] ;Recover near ground
type = SelfState
triggerall = stateno = 6050
triggerall = Vel Y > 0
triggerall = Pos Y >= -20
triggerall = alive
triggerall = CanRecover
trigger1 = Command = "recovery"
trigger2 = var(16) = 1
trigger2 = var(23)>=var(22)
value = 5200 ;HITFALL_RECOVER

[State -2]; Recover in mid air
type = selfState
triggerall = stateno = 6050
triggerall = Vel Y > -1
triggerall = alive
triggerall = CanRecover
trigger1 = Command = "recovery"
trigger2 = var(16) = 1
trigger2 = var(23)>=var(22)
value = 5210 ;HITFALL_AIRRECOVER

-Downloading this character from Mugen Guild ensures that this is the latest version.

-New Mechanic: Not Over Yet

   +All Distortion Drives deal 20% more damage (Stacks with Ultra Burst's damage buff)
   +Immediately Gain 500 Meter

Introduction
==========================================================================================
This Tager uses a custom gameplay style. Though he's not source accurate, he still plays similarly to how he does in Cross Tag while having new stuff and a couple of things that he had in Blazblue. This read me will explain how this gameplay style works. His move list can be found in the .png included in this folder.
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Default Button Layout
==========================================================================================
A, B, and C: Attack Buttons

X: Rapid Cancel

Y: Dodge

Z: Grab
==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================
Gameplay Mechanics
==========================================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dodge (Y)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a very short amount of time, you'll become invulnerable and can pass through the opponent and their projectiles. Just pressing Y will keep you stationary, pressing Y and forward at the same time will have you move forward a short distance, and pressing Y and back will have you back dash. The stationary dodge can also be done in the air. You will become vulnerable again near the end of the dodge animation, so be carful about how you time it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grab (Z)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once again, pretty self explanatory. Overrides the opponent's guard, but only works if they're not in the air and not in a hit state. As long as the grab is not registered as a counter, The opponent will be able to break out of this by inputting A+B, B+C, X+Y, or Z within 14 frames after being grabbed. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Air Grab (Z in the air)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inversely, only works on airborne opponents and can work even when they're in a hit state. Can be used as a combo ender.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dash Grab (66Z)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Works on airborne opponents and standing opponents even when they're in a hit state. However, it won't work on crouching opponents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapid Cancel (X When your attack has made contact with the opponent) (Costs 1000 meter) (Costs 500 meter if used during a Distortion Drive)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using this will immediately put you in a neutral state, this can be used to extend combos, make otherwise unsafe moves safe, or make you more unpredictable to your opponent. Holding Forward or back while inputing the command will immediately have you run or back dash respectively (Air Dash Forward/Back when in the air), Holding up will immediately make you jump, and holding down while in the air will quickly bring you back to the ground.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dead Angle Attack (Press Forward and X or Forward and B+C While guarding) (Costs 1000 meter)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cancels your guard animation into an invulnerable attack animation that sends the opponent flying backward. Deals damage, but doesn't kill.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burst (y+z while getting hit) (Can only be used once per round) (Doesn't work if you're being thrown or being hit by a super move)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deploys a non damaging blast around your character that sends you opponent flying away from you. A poorly timed burst can leave open for even more damage, so be carful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ultra Burst (y+z while in a neutral state) (Can only be used once per round)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using this will put you in a powered up state that gives the following benefits:
 +Health and Meter will gradually recover overtime (Unless you're taking damage)
 +Damage output will be increased by 20%
 +Timer will be frozen
 +Hitting the opponent with the Ultra Burst will launch them upward and will be unable to recover from it
 +Hitting the opponent with the ultra burst will also grant 500 meter instantly
The time that the Ultra Burst state will last is proportionate to the amount of health lost prior to activating, Attempting an astral heat will immediately end the Ultra Burst state

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake up Action
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wake up animation can be canceled into a forward dodge or a back dash. In Tager's case, he can also cancel into Charged Lightening

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter hit properties
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All attacks will deal bonus damage if they hit the opponent while they're attacking and in some cases, causes more hit stun and more unrecoverable time.
